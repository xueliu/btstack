# Introduction #
The Object Exchange Protocol (OBEX) was developed as part of the IrDA specification to transmit data over an Infrared link. OBEX for Bluetooth provides the same protocol hierarchy as for the IrDA standard.

# Details #

The OBEX protocol sits on top of the [RFCOMM](RFCOMM.md) protocol and also requires [SDP](SDP.md) for incoming data.  It is not implemented in the BTstack yet.
