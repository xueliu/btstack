# Introduction #
Although CC256x-based Bluetooth Modules provide the standard H4 interface, they cannot be used without an extended init script (also called "Service Pack") by Texas Instruments.

Since Dec 2011, TI releases the Service Packs for most chipsets in the BTS binary format on their wiki: http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC256x_Downloads
